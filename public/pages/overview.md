# ðŸ“– Overview

## Summary

As a Computer Science student, I've gained practical experience through roles that blend technology with impactful projects. At the California Department of Water Resources, I've worked on integrating GIS data into water management systems and developing web applications, directly contributing to the improvement of water resource management and internal processes. My internship at 30 Days Coding allowed me to dive deep into web development, using React and Framer Motion to create engaging user experiences, and managing online community interactions. My experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, teamwork, and problem-solving, positioning me to make meaningful contributions in tech-driven roles.
